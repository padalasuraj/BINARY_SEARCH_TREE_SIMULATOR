# Binary Search Tree (BST) Simulator Project

Welcome to the Binary Search Tree (BST) Simulator project! This is a simple educational project aimed at helping you understand and visualize the operations of a Binary Search Tree, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

## Project Overview

A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure that follows the principles of a binary tree, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. It maintains a specific property: for every node `n`, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than `n` and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than `n`. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

The simulator allows you to interact with a virtual Binary Search Tree, visualize its structure, and observe how various operations are performed on it.

## Features

- **Visualization:** The simulator provides a graphical representation of the BST, making it easy to understand the arrangement of nodes and their relationships.

- **Insertion:** You can add new nodes to the BST while maintaining the binary search tree property.

- **Search:** Test the search functionality by looking for a specific value in the BST and observing the steps taken to find it.

- **Deletion:** Explore how nodes are deleted from the tree while ensuring that the binary search tree property is preserved.

- **Traversal:** Experience different tree traversal algorithms, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal, to understand how they work and what order they visit the nodes.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred method.

2. **Dependencies:** The simulator is built using [Python](https://www.python.org/), and the graphical visualization uses [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Make sure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies using the following command:

3. **Run the Simulator:** Navigate to the project directory and run the main simulation script:

4. **Interact:** Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulator. You can use keyboard inputs to perform various operations, and the graphical visualization will update accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Insertion:** Enter a value to insert a new node into the tree. The simulator will show the updated tree structure after insertion.

2. **Search:** Provide a value to search for in the tree. The simulator will display the steps taken to find the value, highlighting the path.

3. **Deletion:** Specify a value to delete from the tree. The simulator will demonstrate how the node is removed while maintaining the binary search tree property.

4. **Traversal:** Choose a traversal algorithm to see the order in which nodes are visited during that traversal.
